# Myxedema Crisis and Falls: Evidence for Causal Connection to Traumatic Brain Injury

**Severe hypothyroidism with TSH levels >70 mIU/L demonstrates clear causal connections to falls and traumatic injuries through multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, with documented cases showing falls as presenting symptoms rather than independent events.** The medical literature provides compelling evidence that untreated severe hypothyroidism can precipitate falls and altered consciousness leading to trauma, particularly in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease. This comprehensive analysis reveals that falls often occur during the prodromal phase of myxedema coma, representing a critical warning sign rather than coincidental trauma.

## Clinical presentation directly precipitates falls

Myxedema coma, despite its name, rarely presents as immediate coma but rather follows a progressive deterioration pattern with significant fall risk during the prodromal phase. **The clinical triad of altered mental status, motor dysfunction, and cardiovascular compromise creates a perfect storm for falls and trauma.**

The neurological manifestations are particularly striking. Cerebellar ataxia affects 10-30% of patients with severe hypothyroidism, causing wide-based, unsteady gait with lateral instability. Case studies document TSH levels of 88 mIU/L presenting primarily with gait ataxia, while a documented case with TSH of 405.5 mIU/L showed severe sensorimotor polyneuropathy with bilateral foot drop and persistent distal weakness even after treatment. These motor deficits directly impair balance and protective reflexes, making falls virtually inevitable.

Mental status changes compound the physical vulnerability. Progressive confusion, decreased attentiveness, and impaired decision-making capacity affect hazard recognition and safety awareness. The phenomenon of "myxedema madness" - psychosis occurring in some cases - leads to unpredictable behavior that further increases accident risk. Patients experience cognitive slowing that affects reaction times critical for preventing falls.

## Cardiovascular collapse mechanisms causing syncope

The cardiovascular manifestations of severe hypothyroidism create multiple pathways to syncope and falls. **Complete atrioventricular block with heart rates as low as 22 beats per minute has been documented in patients with TSH >100 mIU/L, causing immediate syncope risk.**

A 75-year-old male with TSH >100 presented with complete AV block and heart rate of 22 bpm, experiencing recurrent syncope episodes. Another case documented a 42-year-old female with TSH >98 who developed sick sinus syndrome with 4.5-second cardiac arrest episodes. These profound bradyarrhythmias reduce cardiac output by 30-50%, directly compromising cerebral perfusion and consciousness.

Orthostatic hypotension represents another critical mechanism. Autonomic dysfunction with loss of baroreceptor reflex integrity creates severe positional blood pressure drops. Cases document blood pressure falling to 80/60 mmHg with position changes, particularly affecting elderly patients with already compromised cerebral autoregulation. The combination of bradycardia, reduced cardiac output, and orthostatic intolerance creates a hemodynamic environment where falls become unavoidable.

Pericardial effusion, present in 3-37% of severely hypothyroid patients, can progress to cardiac tamponade. Unique to hypothyroidism, these patients lack the compensatory tachycardia typically seen in tamponade, with documented cases showing heart rates of only 65-80 bpm during hemodynamic compromise. One case required emergency pericardiocentesis after draining over 1300mL of fluid.

## Timeline reveals progressive fall risk before coma

The progression to myxedema coma follows a predictable timeline that clearly establishes fall risk as an early manifestation rather than a late complication. **The prodromal period typically extends over weeks to months, with mobility decline and falls occurring well before the development of stupor or coma.**

The clinical progression follows distinct stages. During the early phase lasting weeks to months, patients experience classic hypothyroid symptoms with increasing fatigue and cold intolerance. The intermediate stage, spanning days to weeks, brings progressive lethargy, decreased intellectual capacity, and critically, decreased mobility. Medical literature specifically identifies "decreased mobility" as an atypical presentation in elderly hypothyroid patients, occurring during this prodromal phase before full decompensation.

The late prodromal stage sees the development of stupor, significant hypothermia, and bradycardia - but patients remain ambulatory enough to fall. Only in the final crisis stage, triggered by a precipitating event like infection or cold exposure, does true altered consciousness and organ failure develop. This timeline demonstrates that fall risk peaks during the intermediate to late prodromal phases when patients retain enough mobility to ambulate but lack the neurological and cardiovascular reserve to maintain balance.

Winter vulnerability adds another dimension. Ninety percent of myxedema coma cases occur during winter months, with cold exposure serving as both a precipitating factor for decompensation and an environmental hazard increasing fall risk on icy surfaces.

## Case literature documents falls as presenting symptoms

Multiple case reports establish falls as presenting symptoms of severe hypothyroidism rather than independent events. **A landmark 1993 case documented a 70-year-old woman with drop attacks - sudden falls without warning or loss of consciousness - that completely resolved with levothyroxine treatment and returned when medication was discontinued, proving direct causation.**

A 58-year-old male with TSH 97.62 mIU/L was found on his apartment floor after being missing for two days, presenting with confusion, severe hypothermia (82°F), and the classic features of myxedema. An 81-year-old female with alcohol use disorder presented to the emergency department specifically for "unstable gait and recurrent falls" over six months, initially misdiagnosed as alcohol withdrawal before myxedema coma was recognized.

Population studies reinforce these case findings. The Rotterdam Study of 2,645 participants found clinical hypothyroidism associated with significantly worse global gait patterns (β = -0.61; p = 0.004), with TSH levels positively associated with wider base of support - a gait abnormality directly linked to increased fall risk. Even subclinical hypothyroidism showed worse gait patterns, with the Mexican Health and Aging Study demonstrating a 79% increased incidence of falls in patients with TSH 4.5-10 μU/ml.

The pattern of "found down" presentations appears repeatedly in emergency medicine literature. Patients discovered on the floor with altered mental status, initially worked up for trauma, are later diagnosed with myxedema coma when laboratory results reveal extreme TSH elevation. This presentation pattern is so common that emergency medicine protocols now emphasize checking thyroid function in elderly patients found down, especially during winter months.

## Precipitating factors compound vulnerability

Multiple factors can precipitate myxedema coma in patients with severe hypothyroidism, with trauma itself potentially serving as the triggering event. **Infections remain the most common precipitant, but physical stress including trauma, surgery, or burns can overwhelm the limited compensatory mechanisms in severely hypothyroid patients.**

Medications present particular risks. Sedatives, opioids, and anesthetics depress central nervous system function already compromised by hypothyroidism. Lithium inhibits thyroid hormone release, while amiodarone blocks peripheral T4 to T3 conversion. These medications not only worsen hypothyroidism but also independently increase fall risk through sedation and orthostatic effects.

Environmental stress, particularly cold exposure, acts as both a precipitant and a fall risk factor. The age-related decrease in temperature sensing combined with hypothyroid-induced lower heat production creates vulnerability to hypothermia, which further impairs motor function and cognition. Physical or emotional stress triggers decompensation through increased metabolic demands that cannot be met without adequate thyroid hormone.

## Pathophysiology in elderly CKD patients amplifies risk

Elderly patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 requiring dialysis face compounded risks for both myxedema coma and falls. **CKD fundamentally alters thyroid hormone metabolism through multiple mechanisms that increase vulnerability to severe hypothyroidism while simultaneously creating diagnostic challenges.**

The kidneys normally convert T4 to active T3, but CKD patients have decreased 5'-deiodinase activity, resulting in low T3 syndrome affecting 76% of end-stage renal disease patients. Urinary protein losses, including thyroid-binding proteins, further reduce circulating hormone levels. Hyperphosphatemia inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis while accumulated uremic toxins interfere with thyroid function at multiple levels.

TSH interpretation becomes problematic in CKD. While general population normal ranges extend to 4.5 mIU/L, euthyroid CKD patients may have TSH levels of only 0.5-2.0 mIU/L. Uremia affects TSH glycosylation, compromising its biological activity, while the normal circadian rhythm of TSH secretion is lost. These alterations mean that a TSH of 73 mIU/L in a CKD patient represents even more severe dysfunction than in patients with normal kidney function.

Drug interactions compound the problem. Phosphate binders like sevelamer reduce levothyroxine absorption by 25%. Dialysis itself affects medication clearance - heparin used during hemodialysis causes false elevations in free T4 levels lasting 2-15 minutes. Patients often require higher levothyroxine doses to compensate for dialysis losses, but absorption is impaired by the multiple medications CKD patients typically take.

Dialysis-related hemodynamic instability adds another layer of fall risk. Intradialytic hypotension from rapid fluid removal causes hemodynamic instability that persists for hours post-dialysis. When combined with hypothyroid-induced bradycardia and orthostatic dysfunction, the post-dialysis period becomes particularly high-risk for falls.

## Differential diagnosis considerations for trauma presentation

When severe hypothyroidism presents with trauma, distinguishing whether the thyroid dysfunction caused the fall or represents an incidental finding requires careful analysis. **Red flags suggesting hypothyroidism as the primary cause include unexplained fall mechanisms, recurrent falls over weeks to months, and associated symptoms of progressive fatigue and cold intolerance preceding the trauma.**

The physical examination provides critical clues. Bradycardia below 50 bpm, hypothermia below 95°F, delayed deep tendon reflex relaxation, and myxedematous features like puffy facies and macroglossia point toward hypothyroidism as causative. Laboratory findings of elevated creatine kinase above 1000 U/L from hypothyroid myopathy, combined with hyponatremia and the markedly elevated TSH, support this conclusion.

Conditions causing both elevated TSH and falls must be considered. Amiodarone causes hypothyroidism in 14% of patients while also precipitating cardiac arrhythmias. Lithium affects both thyroid function and neurological stability. Age-related factors compound the diagnostic challenge - subclinical hypothyroidism affects 10-25% of elderly patients and often coexists with other fall risk factors.

The emergency assessment must balance trauma evaluation with metabolic investigation. While the ABC approach and trauma survey take priority, early thyroid function testing in appropriate clinical contexts prevents missed diagnoses. Altered mental status out of proportion to apparent trauma severity, especially with hypothermia and bradycardia, should trigger immediate consideration of myxedema coma.

## Reversibility strengthens causal connection

The reversibility of symptoms with thyroid hormone replacement provides the strongest evidence for causation. **The documented case of drop attacks that resolved completely with levothyroxine and returned with medication discontinuation establishes definitive proof that severe hypothyroidism can directly cause falls.**

Most neurological symptoms show significant improvement with treatment. Cerebellar function typically recovers within 8-12 weeks, while peripheral neuropathy may require months to years for complete resolution. Cardiovascular abnormalities respond more rapidly - AV conduction often recovers within 4-7 days, and heart rate normalizes in 2-4 weeks. Pericardial effusions resolve over months.

However, extremely severe cases may have incomplete recovery. Patients with TSH levels exceeding 400 mIU/L have shown persistent neurological deficits despite treatment, including residual weakness and gait abnormalities. This incomplete recovery in the most severe cases underscores the importance of early recognition and treatment before irreversible damage occurs.

## Conclusion

The evidence overwhelmingly supports that severe hypothyroidism with TSH >70 mIU/L can cause falls and altered consciousness leading to traumatic brain injury, rather than trauma being purely coincidental. **Healthcare providers must maintain high clinical suspicion for thyroid dysfunction in elderly patients presenting with falls, particularly those with chronic kidney disease during winter months.**

Emergency physicians should include thyroid function testing in the workup of elderly patients found down or presenting with unexplained falls. The constellation of bradycardia, hypothermia, altered mental status, and elevated creatine kinase should trigger immediate consideration of myxedema coma, even when trauma appears to be the primary problem.

For patients with known severe hypothyroidism, fall prevention becomes critical. Environmental modifications, medication compliance monitoring, and increased vigilance during winter months can prevent the trauma that might precipitate full myxedema crisis. Recognition that decreased mobility and recurrent falls may represent early warning signs of decompensation should prompt urgent endocrine evaluation and treatment optimization.

The bidirectional relationship between trauma and myxedema coma - where hypothyroidism causes falls and trauma precipitates further decompensation - creates a particularly dangerous clinical scenario requiring prompt recognition and aggressive management to prevent mortality rates that can exceed 60% even with treatment.
